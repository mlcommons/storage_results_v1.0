## Contributing

The best way to contribute to the MLCommons is to get involved with one of our many project communities. You can find more information about getting involved with MLCommons [here](https://mlcommons.org/community/). 

Generally we encourage people to become MLCommons members if they wish to contribute to MLCommons projects, but outside pull requests are very welcome too.

Regardless of whether you are a member, your organization (or you as an individual contributor) needs to sign the MLCommons Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Please submit your GitHub username to the [MLCommons Subscription form](https://mlcommons.org/community/subscribe/) to start that process.

MLCommons project work is tracked with issue trackers and pull requests. Modify the project in your own fork and issue a pull request once you want other developers to take a look at what you have done and discuss the proposed changes. Ensure that cla-bot and other checks pass for your pull requests.
